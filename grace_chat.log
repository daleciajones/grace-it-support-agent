[2025-11-03 08:14:52] grace: If you cannot connect to the company Wi-Fi, follow these steps:

1. Make sure Wi-Fi is turned on in your device settings.
2. Select the correct company network name from the list.
3. When prompted, enter your network username and password.
4. If you receive an error, click “Forget Network,” reconnect, and re-enter your credentials.
5. Check if other devices nearby can connect; if they cannot, the issue may be network-wide.
6. If the problem continues, restart your device and try again.
7. If you still cannot connect, submit a ticket to the IT Helpdesk and include:
   - Your device name
   - The Wi-Fi network you tried connecting to
   - Any error messages you saw

[2025-11-03 08:19:17] grace: If an app or file says, “Access denied” or “You don’t currently have permission to access this file,” follow these steps:

1. Double-check that you’re logged in with your work account.
2. If it’s a shared document, ask the file owner to confirm your access.
3. Go to the Company Portal > Access Requests > submit a form for permission.
4. Include in your form:
   - File or system name
   - Your department
   - Level of access needed (view or edit)
5. You’ll get an email once access is approved. Log out, then back in to apply changes.
6. If access is still denied after approval, contact the IT Helpdesk for troubleshooting.
