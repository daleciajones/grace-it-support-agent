Password Reset Instructions:
If you receive a message that your password has expired or needs to be changed, follow these steps: 

1. Go to the company portal and submit a ticket for a password change.
2. Once your ticket is accepted, the onscreen instructions will appear to create a new password.
3. Type your new password and confirm it by retyping it. 
4. After changing your password, lock your computer and sign in again using your new password. 
5. If you cannot reset your password after the ticket is approved, contact the IT Helpdesk for further assistance. 

Reminder: 
Never share your password with anyone. 
Password resets and access tickets are monitored for security and compliance.
